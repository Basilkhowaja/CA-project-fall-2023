This is our computer architecture project repository. In this project we were assigned to implement a sorting algorithm on RISC-V processor. Then in task 2 we made pipelining registers and implemented pipelining on the RISC-V processor.
since there are always stalls and hazards, so for dealing with it we made a HDU to detect stalls in the program which was done in task 3.
