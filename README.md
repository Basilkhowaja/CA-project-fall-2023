This is our CA project repository. in this project we were assigned to implement a sorting algorithm on RISC-V processor. then in task 2 we made pipelining registers and implemented pipelining on the RISC-V processor.
since there are always stalls and hazards, so for dealing with it we made a HDU to detect stalls in the program.
group members: basil khowaja, saif nazir and hania kashif.
